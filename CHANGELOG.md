    - Enhanced `M2Vertex::parse_with_validation()` with comprehensive bone index validation
    - Invalid indices automatically clamped to root bone (index 0) for safety
    - Prevents rendering failures and vertex positioning corruption

    - Zero-weight vertices now automatically assigned full weight to root bone
    - Ensures all vertices participate in skeletal animation properly
    - Maintains model deformation integrity during animation playback
